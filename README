xbmcshell

Vastly updated xbmcshell utility compatible with XBMC 12.0 Frodo

It contains a dynamic hirearchical object space used to dynamically map
to XBMC API 6.0 api calls.

A master xbmcrpc class provides a container object for xbmcrpc interface
classes which are containers for xbmc method calls.

e.g. xbmc.Application maps directly to API calls of Application.*

No introspection or checking of calls is performed, making the API 
interface compatible with all XBMC changes, however code calling the
API may need to be modified.

A basic keyboard and other controls are also provided through the 
command line interface.
