xbmcshell
A simple JSON-RPC library and shell interface for XBMC (in development)

The more interesting part of this package is located in lib/xbmcremote.py which is
a Python JSON-RPC implementation designed for XBMC

Note:

This repository contains other code from Team XBMC, with an ultimate plan to include
some event handling within the same utility.
